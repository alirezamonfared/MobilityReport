This is the source code for the mobility inference algorithms.
For Technical details of the algorithm please read the accompanying paper/


-------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

(a)Requirements:
1- MATLAB:
MATLAB® is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming.
It's a commercial product. If you do not have an academic licencse for MATLA, you can purchase a (student) license at
http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/


2- IPopt:
Ipopt (Interior Point OPTimizer, pronounced eye-pea-Opt) is a software package for large-scale ​nonlinear optimization. 
Ipopt is open source, you can download and build it on your system. For details please visti:
http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/node10.html

It is recommended that you use SVN to get the trunk version of Ipopt at:
https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/browser/trunk?order=name

3 - HSL libraries:
Ipopt uses HSL libraries to solve optimization problems. Most of HSL libraries are commercial, but academic licensisng
is avaialble free of charge. Detials on obtaining HSL libraries is given in Ipopt website. please visit:
http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/node16.html


(For the trunk version, the corresponding instructions are:
https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/BuildTools/ThirdParty/HSL/stable/1.4/INSTALL.HSL
)

(b)Installation:
1-
Matlab can be eaily installed on a Windows, Linux or Mac using the steps provided by MathWorks.

2-
For ipopt, it is recommeneded that you install on a linux machine. You may need to change the configure script
based on the requirements of your operating systems. More details are avaialble on Ipopt website or you can ask
specific questions on Ipopt mailing list (http://list.coin-or.org/mailman/listinfo/ipopt)
For ubuntu 12.04 64-Bit, we have used the foloowing configure script:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/Applications/IpOpt/install --with-matlab-home=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a CXX='g++-4.6 -m64' CC='gcc-4.6 -m64' F77='gfortran -m64' ADD_CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -fexceptions -DFUNNY_LAPACK_FINT" ADD_CFLAGS="-fPIC -fexceptions" ADD_FFLAGS="-fPIC -fexceptions" --with-blas="-L/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/ -lblas" --with-lapack="-L/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/ -llapack" --without-mumps --disable-shared --enable-static

3- You also need to build the Matlab interface for Ipopt. Instructions to do so are availabe at:
https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/wiki/MatlabInterface

We have experienced incompatibilities and crashes in Matlab in our linux system due to the fact that MATLAB and Ipopt may use
different versions of BLAS and LAPACK librarie. One suggestion to solve this is to use the 'Atlas' implementation of
BLAS and LAPACK which is avaialble on Linux systems free of charge (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/)
After installing Atlas libraries, you need to tell the Ipopt configure script where the libraries are. In a regular
linux machine, you need the following options: 

--with-blas="-L/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/ -lblas" --with-lapack="-L/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/ -llapack"

Also set the option ADD_CXXFLAGS="-DFUNNY_LAPACK_FINT" for compatibility reasons.
You also need to set the environment variables for MATLAB to use the Atlas implementations. To do so, in the
same terminal windows from which you run MATLAb, set the variables before running it, as follows:

export LAPACK_VERSION=/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/liblapack.so
export BLAS_VERSION=/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/libblas.so

Finally, do not forget to set the path for the mex file that you created from Ipopt. An example of doing so is
as follows:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/IpOpt/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

You should now be able to run the examples in the Ipopt MATALB directory:
(./Ipopt/contrib/MatlabInterface/examples)

4- To test the mobility inference code, you can either write your own examples or you can run either of our test files:
"TestIpopt.m" : Gives you three options to run the algorithm for RWP, RPGM or SLAW as seen in the paper.
"TestHaggle.m": Run this file directly to reproduce the results for HaggleInfocom2005 trace
