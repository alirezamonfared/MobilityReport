\begin_layout Abstract
Recording locations of mobile nodes and connectivity between them is essential
 in the study of various types of wireless networks, including but not limited
 to opportunistic networks.
 Working with mobility information gives an extra degree of freedom in the
 study of such networks, while in a contact log, a lot of information like
 the locations of the nodes and their velocities is irretrievably lost.
 On the other hand, contact information can be measured more easily compared
 to detailed locations of the nodes.
 In this paper, we present a solution for inferring mobility from contact
 information.
 This technique uses a simple non-linear optimization approach to suppress
 the problem as a feasibility problem with fundamental constraints on the
 mobility of the nodes.
 In this paper, we introduce our technique and its underlying assumptions,
 and discuss applicability of more than one input to enhance the performance
 of inferred mobility.

 and record node locations over time.
 These

 can be combined with radio models to produce network connectivity for simulatio
n studies.
 Measuring node locations with fine-grained time and space granularity is
 challenging, however.
 Outdoor positioning systems are sensitive to weather and obstacles, while
 indoor positioning systems generally rely on availability of WiFi or other
 signal infrastructure that may not be available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an alternative,

 measure and record pairwise node connectivity over time and do not require
 accurate positioning systems.
 Because they come from radio transmissions, contact traces are able to
 capture environmental effects on communication capability, such as obstacle
 effects, that are missing from mobility traces.
 Contact traces can record on-off timing information about links, hence
 they can be more compact than mobility traces that must record data at
 every time instant.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While recording contact opportunities, a lot of information is irretrievably
 lost.
 No information on exact location an velocity of the nodes can be retrieved
 from a contact trace.
 As time elapses, the amount of this information decreases and it becomes
 more and more difficult to even relatively locate the nodes.
 Such traces are only representative of the particular context in which
 they are measured.
 For example, a WiFi radio contact trace seems not to be appropriate to
 study a scenario possessing the same characteristics in every aspect, except
 a Bluetooth radio without running the entire trace collection experiment
 again which carries a significant organizational overhead in preparing,
 distributing and collecting contact loggers, not to mention non-technical
 issues related to legality and participant consent.
 In a similar fashion, every small change in the contact scenario necessitates
 repetition of the whole collection process.

We are interested in the problem of inferring a plausible mobility trace
 from a contact trace.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plausible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we mean a trace that is consistent with the contacts, and not originating
 from a given radio model.
 In general, there may be multiple mobility traces that are consistent with
 a given trace.
 We do not attempt to enumerate them.
 Although this plausible mobility might not match the original locations,
 it matches to a mobility trace that could have generated the same contact
 trace, or a trace very similar to it.
 It can be discussed that the exact locations of the nodes is not required
 in most the experiments that deal with studying mobility or modifying contacts
 , unless the researcher has access to a

\begin_layout Standard
Coming from the contact domain to the mobility domain, may provide researchers
 with opportunities not present with the contacts alone, such as transforming
 the settings of the original data collection, one that assumes a different
 radio, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our proposed algorithm is based on optimizing a mobility trace using the
 limited information from the contacts.
 It operates by solving a feasibility problem for a small set of fundamental
 constraints on mobility of the nodes.
 We will describe the details of the algorithm in this report and we have
 made the code publicly available [CITATION NEEDED]

The problem of mobility inversion, though, is different from the localization
 problem, in the sense that it combines a contact model, and a contact trace
 showing the opportunities among nodes to get in touch to obtain a mobility

 Few solutions have been proposed for this specific problem.
 Wang et al.

 solves the same problem by dividing it into smaller subproblems, and relying
 on decreasing number of possibilities.
 Our analysis of such approach has proven that the complexity of such solution
 grows exponentially with increasing number of nodes, and hence is only
 applicable to small scenarios.
 Ristanovic et al.

 suggests a solution that relies on knowledge of some anchor nodes, with
 fixed and known location, which can give a rough estimate of location of
 mobile Bluetooth devices that have a low range.
 The immediate downside is the dependence on the location of devices and
 the underlying technologies used.

 by the work in dynamic graph drawing.
 They define three fundamental constraints on the mobility of the nodes

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The paper assumes a simple circular transmission range for the all nodes,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first constraint states that no node can move faster than a maximum
 speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{max}$
\end_inset

, and the other two confines the distance between two nodes based on their
 previous and future contact opportunities.
 The authors then define, an attractive force, similar to the classical
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spring
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 force on each node from all of its contacts, as well as a repulsive force,
 similar to the classical 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coulomb
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 force, as well as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drag
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 force to prevent nodes going excessively away from each other when borders
 are not obvious.
 Equilibrium of these forces on each node, determines its location.
 Together, this gives a relative set of locations satisfying the given contacts.
 A major disadvantage of this approach is the necessity of a smart choice
 of many constants involved in the calculation of the forces.
 Since there is no rule of thumb for many of these parameters, the performance
 of the application becomes dependent of the specific scenario under study,
 and it may become a series of trial and errors when such information is
 not available.

\begin_layout Section
Background 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we define the basic concepts of mobility and contacts as
 they have been used in our proposed algorithm, and provide the background
 knowledge required for understanding the context and technical details
 of our mobility inversion algorithm.
 We start this section by a few definitions.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Contact Trace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A contact trace is a log of contact-start and contact-end events, each labeled
 with a time stamp and with the identifiers of the two nodes involved in
 the contact event.
 Mathematically, contact traces can be represented using a sequence of graphs
 showing the connections over time, which are called 
\emph on
evolving graphs
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bui2003evolving"

\end_inset

.
 We are interested in contact traces collected in the course of an experiment.
 In such experiments, mobile devices equipped with a wireless interface
 are attached to moving entities (e.g., people or vehicles).
 These mobile devices sample their environments periodically and log the
 presence of neighboring nodes.
 At the conclusion of the experiment these logs are collected and a contact
 trace is constructed from them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contact-start events occur when two mobile devices come within radio range
 of each other.
 Contact-end events occur when two mobile devices who were previously in
 contact are not within the radio range of each other's devices.
 Many aspects of the radio environment can affect these events.
 In general, contact trace becomes meaningful when studied along with a
 
\emph on
contact model.

\emph default
 In the simplest model, two nodes are defined to be in contact whenever
 their distance is less than a given transmission range, and disconnected
 otherwise.
 There is a debate that this model is too simplistic due to many reasons
 including the existence of obstacles, lack of symmetry in real contacts,
 inequality of signal strength inside the assumed transmission circle, etc
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kotz2003mistaken"

\end_inset

, but this model has been used extensively due its simplicity and the fact
 that it allows to focus on other, perhaps more significant factors in the
 experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\emph on
Mobility Trace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mobility trace is a log of locations of nodes over time.
 Similar to a contact trace, a mobility trace can also be unsynchronized
 or synchronized, synthetically modeled or corresponding to real data from
 GPS equipped devices or association to the base stations of a 3G/WiFi network.

 (BFGS), an approximation of Newton's method that seeks the stationary point
 of a function by finding the zero of its derivative.
 l-BFGS-B, needs an initial point to seek this stationary point, which is

 Since l-BFGS-B still needs an initial point to seek the stationary point

 hops among every pair of nodes in

 can be then passed to the version of the optimization problem that ignores
 the speed constraint to find the first value of

 are compatible.

\begin_layout Standard
The optimization problem to be solved in the iterations of algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is the second revision to the basic algorithm.
 In this case, for every two nodes, we can limit their distance at every
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to two values.
 One is the transmission range 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{k}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the contact trace 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{k}$
\end_inset

with the largest transmission range that still shows the two nodes not to
 be connected, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{k}(i,j,t)=0$
\end_inset

, and the other is the transmission range 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{l}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the contact trace 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{l}$
\end_inset

with the smallest transmission range that still shows the two nodes to be
 connected, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{k}(i,j,t)=1$
\end_inset

.
 Note that in general case, we may have 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{k}=0$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the two nodes are connected in all contact traces for that specific time
 instance, and we can also have 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{l}\rightarrow\infty$

 that the two nodes are never connected in any contact trace for that specific
 time instance.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we briefly review the main advantages of our mobility inversion
 algorithm, compared to the force based algorithm of Whitbeck et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "whitbeck2011encounters"

\end_inset

.
 We will also point out the drawbacks of the algorithm.
 We will discuss the performance metrics in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simplicity of the front-end is the first advantage of our algorithm.
 In case of the force-based algorithm, calling the algorithm needs not only
 the input contact trace, but also many parameters need to be set.
 These include the rigidity constant 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 and the damping factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 in the attractive force, the intensity constant 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 , cutoff distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{max},$
\end_inset

and parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}$
\end_inset

that affect the intensity of the repulsive force with distance, as well
 as the strength parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of the drag force.
 There is no general rule for setting these parameters, and for the algorithm
 to perform well, these need to be set in a trial and error.
 On the other hand, the optimization algorithm does not need any external
 parameters other than a maximum speed and transmission range, which are
 natural to consider for every scenario and are present in the force-based
 algorithm nevertheless.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A drawback, present in both algorithms is the contact model.
 It has been discussed in the literature, many other factors including but
 not limited to presence of obstacles, fading, path-loss, etc affect the
 connectivity model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kotz2003mistaken"

\end_inset

.
 Despite this, the optimization mobility inversion algorithm is designed
 in a modular manner so that any contact model can be integrated into it.
 Since the solver at the heart of our algorithm, BFGS, can solve any nonlinear
 optimization problem, a new contact model that can be described mathematically,
 and can be derived from a contact trace, possibly with additional information,
 can replace the circular model, without affecting the other modules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second future improvement to the algorithm, should target the computational
 complexity.
 The BFGS solver used in the algorithm does not scale linearly with the
 number of nodes, and this can be a serious drawback to the performance
 of the algorithm on large traces.
 The authors do not know of any solver or feasible modification at the moment
 that can address this completely.
 The only suggestion, which can give marginal improvements, but does not
 remove the nonlinear increases of running time with the number of nodes
 is to implement the algorithm in a lower level language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Performance Evaluation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the mobility inversion algorithm
 proposed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Metrics
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before presenting the evaluations, we need to define a performance metric
 to measure how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the performance of the algorithm on a trace.
 To do this, in the very general framework ,we need to derive measures of
 comparison from the inputs and the outputs of the algorithm.
 Such comparison can be done in three levels as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lowest level of evaluation is done with mobility-mobility comparison.
 Assuming that we have access to the mobility trace from which the input
 contact trace originated, which is only viable for test purposes, we can
 compare the original input mobility trace and the output mobility trace
 for each location, and report a mean squared error over time:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset

We do not expect a good matching in mobility nevertheless, as the proposed
 feasibility does not have a unique solution, and we have shown that it
 actually has many solutions which makes it almost impossible to pick the
 desired output mobility among all these possible solutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next level, we compare the contact traces.
 While the input to our algorithm is a contact trace, we can infer an output
 contact trace with the proper transmission range that the algorithm has
 used at the output and a proper contact model We can then compare the two
 corresponding evolving graphs over time based on the number of missing
 links, i.e.
 present in the input contact trace and missing in the inferred contact
 trace, extra links, i.e.
 only seen in the inferred contact trace, and the sum of these two numbers.
 While a low number of link errors in this level is very desired to be seen
 and is sufficient to have a successful mobility inference, it is not necessary
 for our purposes.
 These errors can be defined as a function of time as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{missing\; link}(t)=\frac{\sum_{i,j}(C_{R}(i,j,t)\wedge(\neg C'_{R}(i,j,t)))}{\sum_{i,j}(C_{R}(i,j,t)\wedge\mathbf{1})}\times100
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{extra\; link}(t)=\frac{\sum_{i,j}((\neg C_{R}(i,j,t))\wedge(C'_{R}(i,j,t))}{\sum_{i,j}(C_{R}(i,j,t)\wedge\mathbf{1})}\times100
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{total\; link}(t)=\frac{\sum_{i,j}(C_{R}(i,j,t)\oplus C'_{R}(i,j,t))}{\sum_{i,j}(C_{R}(i,j,t)\wedge\mathbf{1})}\times100
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{R}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C'_{R}$
\end_inset

 are contact traces corresponding evolving graph of ground truth, aka the
 input to the algorithm, and derived contact which comes from the inferred
 mobility, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix of all ones of the size 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N\times T_{m}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula $\neg$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\oplus$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

 represent element-wise logical NOT, XOR and AND respectively.
 Note that for such comparison to be reasonable, we need both contact traces
 to correspond to the same transmission range 
\begin_inset Formula $R.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the third level of comparisons, we use the definitions from Chen et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Bui et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to compare journeys, i.e.
 space-time paths between node pairs over time.
 In its simplest form, we can categorize node pairs at each time instant
 to three groups:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
S-pairs: Two nodes that are always reachable in space at every instant of
 time after the current time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

As discussed by Chen et.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, A journey, is a space-time path in an evolving graph that connects two
 nodes over the course of time.
 It's represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $J=(R,R_{\delta})$
\end_inset

 in an evolving graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $R=e_{1},e_{2},...,e_{k}$
\end_inset

, the sequence of edges it traverses, and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\delta}=\delta_{1},\delta_{2},...,\delta_{k}$
\end_inset

 the corresponding time instants of edge traversal.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\delta}$
\end_inset

 must be such that each edge traversed is in the evolving graph at the time
 of traversal.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
N-pairs: two that are not reachable after the current time.
 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that S-pair,ST-pair, and N-pairs are a function of time, e.g., that two
 nodes can be an ST-pair at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

, but an N-pair at another time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can then compare the percentage of S-,SP-, and N-pairs at every instant
 of time for the input and inferred contact trace.
 This shows the connectivity characteristics of the trace, and can be used
 as a metric to compare the two traces.

 We do not expect the algorithm to find the exact locations of the nodes,
 since no initial information has been used, but as it is obvious the errors
 in the case of RPGM and DA are increasing over the time.
 This does not happen with RWP.
 We believe that this behavior is due to erratic behavior of RWP.
 In RPGM and DA, the number of possibilities that match the inferred location
 decrease over the time, and there is a higher correlation between the current
 and previous locations.
 This is much more random in case of RWP.
 For this reason, in the former, our algorithm inevitably has to get closer
 to the original locations over the time, and pick one of the fewer possible
 location sets that are compatible with the input contacts.

 show the errors resulted in comparing the input contact trace, and the
 contact trace resulted from the inferred mobility.As we can see these errors
 have some spikes in case of RPGM and is more smooth for RWP and DA.
 This is mostly due to the grouped nature of RPGM and presence of obvious
 communities in that.
 Also it's obvious that the errors for DA are much smaller than the other
 tow models.
 This is due to the fact that most nodes in DA model are wandering in a
 dense area, and number of connections are surprisingly high compared to
 the RWP and RPGM, resulting in a denser connectivity graph.

 shows it for the inferred trace.
 This last results shows that despite errors present in the contact level
 comparison, when compared for connectivity characteristics, our algorithm
 finds an output mobility trace that has the same properties with a high
 precision.
 This ensures that the inferred set of locations can be used in any experiment,
 instead of the original location that had resulted in the input contact
 trace, and yet the same behavior will be observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have presented an algorithm to infer mobility from contacts.
 Our algorithm accepts a contact trace that indicated the connections among
 nodes over time.
 Without any extra information about the locations of these nodes, we infer
 a set of locations, aka a mobility trace, that could have generated these
 contacts.
 Through performance evaluations, we have shown that this inferred mobility
 shows comparable connectivity characteristics compared to the original
 locations from which the input contact trace has come.
 This opens up the opportunity to use these locations in any experiment,
 and avoid the expensive process of collecting location information.
 It also gives rise to an ongoing research to use these locations to infer
 contact traces for other scenarios, which results in transformation of
 a contact trace.

 a local map for that node, and then these nodes are merged to produce a
 global relative map.

Spectral Graph Drawing (SGD) is another solution that is proposed for the
 graph realization problem.
 SGD also defines a minimization problem based on the Laplacian matrix,
 L.
 this matrix is defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=K-W
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\]

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=diag(k_{ii})=\underset{j\epsilon N(i)}{\sum}w_{ij}

\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is a weighting matrix, inversely proportional to the pair-wise distances
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is the diagonal matrix of node degrees.
 SGD solves the following optimization problem to find 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

:

The second constraint in the above equation, ensures that the trivial solution
 of all nodes in the same place is not chosen in favor of the others.
 The selection of variance in this constraint is arbitrary.
 The second constraint, ensures the invariance of the solution under transitions
 by setting a mean of zero.

\end_inset

 argues that like classical MDS, SGD tends to draw the nodes to the center,
 and hence has a poor performance on irregularly-shaped graphs.
 A variant of SGD, called degree normalized spectral graph drawing (DN-SGD)
 is proposed, which updates the second constraint of original SGD with weights
 proportional to degrees, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}KX=1$
\end_inset

.
 SGD, and DN-SGD have been shown to be solvable by finding the generalized
 eigenvalues of the matrices

\begin_inset Formula $K$

 have shown that for DN-SGD to perform reasonably on static sensor network
 localization, a two-step localization, followed by a post-processing to
 filter outliers are required.
