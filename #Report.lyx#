\begin_layout Abstract
Recording locations of mobile nodes and connectivity between them is essential
 in the study of various types of wireless networks, including but not limited
 to opportunistic networks.
 Working with mobility information gives an extra degree of freedom in the
 study of such networks, while in a contact log, a lot of information like
 the locations of the nodes and their velocities is irretrievably lost.
 On the other hand, contact information can be measured more easily compared
 to detailed locations of the nodes.
 In this paper, we present a solution for inferring mobility from contact
 information.
 This technique uses a simple non-linear optimization approach to solve
 the problem as a feasibility problem with fundamental constraints on the
 mobility of the nodes.
 The main contribution of this solution is the possibility to apply more
 than one contact trace as input to enhance the

 of the inferred mobility.

 These

 can be combined with radio models to produce network connectivity for simulatio
n studies.
 Measuring node locations with fine-grained time and space granularity is
 challenging, however.
 Outdoor positioning systems are sensitive to weather and obstacles, while
 indoor positioning systems generally rely on availability of WiFi or other
 signal infrastructure that may not be available.
 On top of this, to capture all the contact opportunities between nodes,
 a large number of GPS devices may be needed

 measure and record pairwise node connectivity over time and do not require
 accurate positioning systems.
 Because they come from radio transmissions, contact traces are able to
 capture environmental effects on communication capability, such as obstacle
 effects, that are missing from mobility traces.
 Contact traces can record on-off timing information about links, hence
 they can be more compact than mobility traces that must record data at
 every time instant.
 In its, simplest form, contacts can be implied by close proximity, although
 this is not the best model to consider and needs to be replaced with more
 accurate models based o the requirements of the study

 has summarized these types of datasets.
 When we measure contact opportunities among the nodes, a lot of information
 is irretrievably lost.
 A contact model, can only roughly tell if two nodes are in vicinity of
 each other or not.
 No information on exact location an velocity of the nodes can be retrieved.
 Besides, as time elapses, this amount of information decreases and becomes
 more and more difficult to even relatively locate the nodes.
 The value of such traces makes them only representative of the particular
 context in which they are measured.
 For example, a WiFi radio contact trace seems not to be appropriate to
 study a scenario possessing the same characteristics in every aspect, except
 a Bluetooth radio without running the entire trace collection experiment
 again which carries a significant organizational overhead in preparing,
 distributing and collecting contact loggers, not to mention non-technical
 issues related to legality and participant consent.
 In a similar fashion, every small change in the contact scenario necessitates
 repetition of the whole collection process.
 It seems that if fine-grained mobility information is available for such
 contact traces, it is possible to re-use the same dataset for a slightly
 different scenario without inuring the burden of data collection repeatedly.

\begin_layout Standard
Although it is not possible to find the original locations of the nodes,
 given only their relative contacts, it is still possible to find a plausible
 mobility, that could have generated the same contact trace, or a trace
 very similar to it.
 It can be discussed that the exact locations of the nodes is not required
 in most the experiments that deal with studying mobility or modifying contacts
 , unless the researcher has access to a

 mobility trace presenting the same characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our proposed algorithm uses the limited information from the contacts to
 infer the mobility.
 Benefits of this is an ability to visualize the movements of the node that
 can give the researcher an ability to view the node dynamics.
 It also allows to perform transformations on the contact traces, such as
 changing node density, adding nodes, changing the transmission range, etc.
 Finally, a plausible mobility trace allows a finer simulation if the radio
 channel.
