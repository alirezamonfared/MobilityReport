\begin_layout Abstract
Recording locations of mobile nodes and connectivity between them is essential
 in the study of various types of wireless networks, including but not limited
 to opportunistic networks.
 Working with mobility information gives an extra degree of freedom in the
 study of such networks, while in a contact log, a lot of information like
 the locations of the nodes and their velocities is irretrievably lost.
 On the other hand, contact information can be measured more easily compared
 to detailed locations of the nodes.
 In this paper, we present a solution for inferring mobility from contact
 information.
 This technique uses a simple non-linear optimization approach to solve
 the problem as a feasibility problem with fundamental constraints on the
 mobility of the nodes.
 The main contribution of this solution is the possibility to apply more
 than one contact trace as input to enhance the

 of the inferred mobility.

 of mobile wireless protocols benefit from real-world traces that measure
 and record node locations over time.
 These

 can be combined with radio models to produce network connectivity for simulatio
n studies.
 Measuring node locations with fine-grained time and space granularity is
 challenging, however.
 Outdoor positioning systems are sensitive to weather and obstacles, while
 indoor positioning systems generally rely on availability of WiFi or other
 signal infrastructure that may not be available.
 On top of this, to capture all the contact opportunities between nodes,
 a large number of GPS devices may be needed

 measure and record pairwise node connectivity over time and do not require
 accurate positioning systems.
 Because they come from radio transmissions, contact traces are able to
 capture environmental effects on communication capability, such as obstacle
 effects, that are missing from mobility traces.
 Contact traces can record on-off timing information about links, hence
 they can be more compact than mobility traces that must record data at
 every time instant.
 Collecting contact traces is also challenging, however, as it requires
 instrumenting nodes with collection capability and conducting a well-planned
 and coordinated collection

 has summarized these types of datasets.
 When we measure contact opportunities among the nodes, a lot of information
 is irretrievably lost.
 A contact model, can only roughly tell if two nodes are in vicinity of
 each other or not.
 No information on exact location an velocity of the nodes can be retrieved.
 Besides, as time elapses, this amount of information decreases and becomes
 more and more difficult to even relatively locate the nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although it is not possible to find the original locations of the nodes,
 given only their relative contacts, it is still possible to find a plausible
 mobility, that could have generated the same contact trace, or a trace
 very similar to it.
 It can be discussed that the exact locations of the nodes is not required
 in most the experiments that deal with studying mobility or modifying contacts
